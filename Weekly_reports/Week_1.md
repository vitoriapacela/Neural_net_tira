# Week 1

## Challenges
My familiarity with neural networks has saved me from some reading, but I foresee problems implementing them in Java. I am not familiar with JUnit and JavaDoc either.

## Time track
Around 3 hours.

## Goals for next week
* Implement data loader
* Test data loader
* Implement neurons, 1-layer network, and loss function.

I would like to get most of the project on the trails next week, but I am aware of my time limitation due to an exam and I probably won't be able to test everything I code.
