# Week 7
## Achievements and learnings
- Preparing the demo was helpful to me, as explaining it also made me understand better what I developed and what lies behind the neural networks.
- I implemented ProgramTest to test the training time and error rate under different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer.
- I also made some plots to compare the time performance and the error rate according to the number of neurons in the hidden layer.
- Improved the documentation for the Implementation and Testing documents.


## Challenges
- I did not implement many tests and my test coverage is low. In order to implement more tests I would have to work more than 8h per week and I was not able dedicate much time beyond this scope because I also had other duties. On the other hand, I was printing my outputs on the go as I developed, in order to check if everything was working correctly. This approach was faster worked well for me. Since my final result is even better than in literature, I believe that my program was not harmed for not having more tests.

## Time track
- Preparing and attending the demo presentation took me about 4h.
- Changing the structure of Program in order to accomodate time tracks: around 1h.
- Implementing ProgramTest: 2h.
- Making plots: 1h.
- Documentation: 4h.
