# Week 5
## Achievements and learnings
- Started the Implementation document and the Testing document.
- Improved JavaDoc documentation and uploaded it.

## Challenges
- Unfortunately I was busy at work and did not have much time to dedicate to this project, but I will compensate that in Week 6. The peer-review also took some time that otherwise I would have dedicated to my own project. Due to my time limitation, I decided to focus on writing and improving my documentation rather than testing, since that will be more important for the person who is peer-reviewing my project.

- I have not pushed my latest changes to the project because they can generate errors. I noticed that I was not obtaining the correct outputs, so I tried to print the weights of each neuron in each layer and I got a null pointer exception that I am not able to fix by myself.

## Time track
- Approximately 2h in the peer-review.
- Approximately 4h in my own project.

## Goals for Week 6
- Implement running time tests.
- Test accuracy of the model.
