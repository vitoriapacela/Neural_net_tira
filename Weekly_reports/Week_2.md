# Week 2

## Achievements and learnings
Programming a neural network from scratch involves many subtasks that I was not certain of how to define. Now I have a code baseline:
- Data loader class to load the MNIST dataset.
- Neuron class that implements the perceptron responses. Also contains the sigmoid activation function.
- Network class that puts together input, hidden, and output layers, using elements from the Neuron class and executing backpropagation.
- Main class to initialize classes and execute visualization.

## Challenges
I was not able to fo to the Paja because I had an exam in the same day. As a result, I still have basic problems running Java, and this is why I haven't been able to document it or test it properly.

## Time track
Around 11 hours.

## Goals for Week 3
Test-driven development. Now that I know how I am dividing the classes to perform my predictions, I hope to test everything I have implemented so far, in the order of implementation.
