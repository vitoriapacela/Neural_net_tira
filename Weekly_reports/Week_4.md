# Week 4
## Achievements and learnings
- Used NetBeans to run the projects and found some major bugs, which were all fixed.
- Started test coverage with JACOCO.
- I changed the whole MNIST data loading structure, based on [this implementation] (https://github.com/turkdogan/mnist-data-reader). Then I had to modify my code to include the new data loader.

## Challenges
- I had a lot of trouble setting up the IDE, first with Eclipse and then with Netbeans.
- After that, I also noticed that many of my tests were not working as they should. I've been fixing them, some of it will be left for the next week.

## Time track
- IDE setup: app. 5h.
- Fixing MNIST dataset loading: app. 4h.
- Fixing tests: 3h.

## Goals for Week 5
- Improve testing.
