# Week 3
## Achievements and learnings
- For the sake of my own learning, I implemented a simple perceptron in python in order to understand how it works, and applied it to the MNIST dataset. This is not covered in this repository.
- I fixed all the errors that I had left from the last week.
- Finally looked into testing in Java and learned assert statements.
- Documentation done with JavaDoc.

## Challenges
- Did not find any way to test the Image class. It may not be needed, but it's open to suggestions.

## Time track
- Approximately 3h fixing code.
- Approximately 4h making tests.
- Approximately 6h coding perceptron in python, although that probably should not be counted here.

## Goals for Week 4
- Make more tests.
- Review documentation and possible bugs.
- Code predictions for a test set.
